Initialization: Choose the number of clusters, K, that you want to create. Initialize K points randomly as the centroids of the clusters.

Assignment: For each data point, calculate the distance between the point and each centroid. Assign the data point to the cluster whose centroid is closest to it. This step forms the initial clusters.

Update: Recalculate the centroids of the newly formed clusters by taking the mean of all data points assigned to each cluster.

Repeat: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence. Convergence occurs when the centroids no longer move significantly or when a maximum number of iterations is reached.

Output: Once convergence is reached, the final clusters are obtained, and each data point is assigned to one of the K clusters.

K-means aims to minimize the within-cluster variance, also known as the inertia or sum of squared distances. It assumes that the clusters have spherical shapes and that the variance within each cluster is similar.

K-means has several applications, including customer segmentation, image compression, document clustering, anomaly detection, and more. However, it also has some limitations, such as sensitivity to the initial centroid positions, the need to specify the number of clusters in advance, and the assumption of equal-sized and spherical clusters.

To implement K-means, you can use various machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn in Python, which provide ready-to-use implementations of the algorithm.
